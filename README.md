# Nuvy
Nuvy is a machine learning and AI-driven web application designed to support users in managing their nutrition, fitness, and overall health goals. The platform leverages a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification algorithm to recommend macro-friendly meals tailored to each user's daily caloric targets. Nuvy features an intuitive autocomplete search function backed by a comprehensive food database, enabling users to log their meals and monitor their macronutrient intake in real time. In addition, Nuvy integrates a Linear Regression model to analyze user-specific inputs—such as current weight, target weight, activity level, and dietary habits. Based on this data, the model intelligently calculates an optimal daily caloric intake and estimated timeline to help users achieve their weight goals as efficiently and sustainably as possible.
